### Goal  
The goal of this project was to explore the Austin housing market dataset, create visualizations of various housing factors, and use Python to find correlations between home prices and attributes such as number of bathrooms, bedrooms, zip code, and more.

### Description  
This dataset contains over 15,000 listings in the Austin area, including location, price, and home features like bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, school ratings, and home types.  

After cleaning and exploring the data, I wrote SQL queries to extract insights and prepare data for visualization. Tableau was used to build a dashboard showcasing these factors, while Python enabled scatter plots and correlation analyses to quantify relationships between price and housing attributes.

### Tools Used  
- **Excel** – data inspection and cleaning  
- **SQL (pgAdmin)** – querying and aggregating housing data  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – plotting and correlation calculations  
- **Tableau** – interactive dashboards of housing market trends  

---

### Results  
- Number of bathrooms had the highest correlation with price: **0.504**  
- Number of bedrooms: **0.299**  
- Average school rating: **0.293**  
- Number of garage spaces: **0.157**  
- Year built had the lowest correlation with price: **0.060**  

These results indicate that certain home features, especially bathrooms and bedrooms, have a stronger impact on price than others like the year the house was built.
