### Global CO₂ Emissions  
**Original Data Source:**  
[Our World in Data – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

### Goal  
The goal of this project was to explore CO₂ emissions by country and continent, and analyze how various factors—such as GDP and population—relate to changes in emissions over time. This was my first complete project using the full data analytics stack: Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I focused on both learning the tools and uncovering meaningful insights from the data.

### Description  
This project uses a global dataset containing yearly data on CO₂ output, emissions by fuel type, population, temperature change, and economic indicators.  

After cleaning and inspecting the data, I wrote SQL queries to examine which countries had increases or decreases in CO₂ emissions, how these trends varied by continent, and how emissions related to GDP. I used Python to run correlation analyses and create visualizations, and Tableau to design dashboards highlighting global, regional, and time-based trends in emissions.

### Tools Used  
- **Excel** – initial inspection and formatting  
- **SQL (pgAdmin)** – filtering, grouping, and aggregating emissions data  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – plotting and correlation analysis  
- **Tableau** – visualizations of global CO₂ trends and country comparisons  

---

### Results  
- Correlation between GDP and CO₂ emissions: **0.965**  
This very strong positive correlation suggests that countries with higher GDPs tend to produce more CO₂ emissions, highlighting the link between economic activity and environmental impact.
