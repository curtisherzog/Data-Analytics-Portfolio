### **Overview & Business Goal**

In todayâ€™s competitive supply chain landscape, organizations must rely on suppliers that consistently deliver on time, provide quality products, and maintain cost efficiency. Poor supplier performance can increase late delivery risk, reduce customer satisfaction, and raise operational costs. This project analyzes supplier reliability using a dataset of orders, shipping records, and product performance. By evaluating KPIs such as on-time delivery rates, defect rates, and profitability, we can identify top-performing suppliers and highlight underperformers. The insights will guide decisions around consolidating orders with reliable partners, renegotiating contracts, or replacing suppliers to improve efficiency, reduce risks, and enhance customer satisfaction.
