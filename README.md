# Curtis Herzog - Data Analytics Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio!

Hi, I'm Curtis! I'm an aspiring data analyst with experience using a range of tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data to support decision-making and drive meaningful change. I'm proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, with a strong grasp of key data analytics techniques including data preparation, wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, dashboard creation, process documentation, and data storytelling.

This portfolio showcases a collection of projects that highlight both my technical expertise and analytical thinking. You'll find SQL scripts, Tableau dashboards, Excel models, Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio analyses, and presentation materials. These projects reflect my ability to structure, interpret, and present data in a way that's clear, impactful, and accessible to a wide audience.
